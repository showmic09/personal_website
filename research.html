            <h1><a id="#ultrasonic_jump">Ultrasonic Scattering and Attenuation</a></h1>
            <p>
              Ultrasound is a sound wave having a frequency of beyond 20000 Hz. Just like normal speech sounds echo is
              also noticed in case of ultrasound. Using the echo of the ultrasound
              different information about the body under investigation (materials, ceramics, biomaterials etc) can be
              obtained. It is one of the most popular non-destrctive methods.
              Ultrasound is used widely in various industries for detection and identification of defects in
              polycrystalline materials.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                But my research interest lies in qualifying polycrystalline materials through ultrasound. Using an
                ultrasonic transducer ultrsonic signal can be transmitted and received.
                When ultrasound travels inside a polycrystalline material it scatters in all direction.
                From the reflected signal of the wave the information about the microstructure of the material can be
                quantified. Two of the main properties of
                ultrasound is its phase velocity and attenuation. Using these properties of ultrasound the
                microstructural properties of a material can be predicted.
                Ultrasonic wave scatters when it passes through the grains of polycrystalline materials. Grain
                boundaries
                are the main sources of ultrasonic scattering and attenuation.
                Ultrasonics theories like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-5096(90)90021-U"
                  target="blank">Weaver's</a>
                model is specially helpful for understanding ultrasonic responses in polycrystalline materials.
                <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/1.5096651" target="blank">Noruzian and Turner</a>
                developed the modifications
                necessary to apply ultrasonic theories to calculate phase velocity
                and attenuation using the discrete synthetic microstructures for cubic polycrystalline materials. The
                goal
                of my research is to further this approach of developing and testing the ultrasonic theories applicable
                to discrete synthetic
                microstructures for complex polycrystalline materials. The animation in this page is my lazy approach
                towards describing the ultrasonic properties.
                However, Iowa State University has built a great <a
                  href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Physics/modepropagation.htm"
                  target="blank">website</a> regarding all the NDT techinquies. I would highly encourage interested
                readers to go through different sections in their website.</span>

        <h1><a id="#synthetic_jump">Synthetic Microstructures</a> </h1>
        <p>
          As I have mentioned before the ultimate goal of the research is to be able to predict the microstructural properties based on the experimental ultrasonic
          measurements. Hopefully one day our group will be able to provide all microstructural information -(grain statistics, texture, defects, phases)
          just by performing some ultrasonic measurements on the sample. But thats far away in future. There are many pieces of the puzzle that needs to be figured out before that.
          To make prediction the relation between theoretical ultrasonic responses and experminetal responses need to be established. Most of my research works 
          is computational based and requires the use of synthetic vloumes. <a href="http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/">DREAM.3D</a> and
          <a href="http://www.neper.info/">Neper</a> are two of the most prominent softwares for creation of two and three dimensional
          synthetic microstructures. Microstructures having different crystal symmetries with realistic euler angles
          and texture can be generated using these softwares. I use the theoretical ultrasonic scattering models to numercially calculate 
          the ultrasonic responses on these synthetic microstructures. Below you will find some of the codes used 
          for creating synthetic microstructures of different tessellations.

          As part of the researcher's community at University of Nebraska-Lincoln I
          have acess to <a href="https://hcc.unl.edu/" target="blank">Holland Computing Center (HCC)</a>. HCC is a
          High Performace

          simulating synthetic
          microstructures with large number of grains and for numerical calculation
          of ultrasonic phase velocity and attenuation HCC is super effective.

              allow researchers to utilize idle super computing resources.
              Using High Throughput Computing(HTC) OSG gives access to super computing power without any charge. Below
