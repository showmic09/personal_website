This was my first time at the Great Plains Network ([GPN](https://www.greatplains.net/)) conference. It is a regional conference. The universities in South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas comprise the GPN. The conference took place in Kansas City from May 31 to June 2nd. I instructed the "Scaling Out Your Research on the Open Science Pool" workshop. The workshop had a great deal of hands on portion. The materials for the workshop can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o0AfBeb65hOEBE1iQLj7pH4V0nB1FiG-/edit#slide=id.p1). [OSG](https://osg-htc.org) is free for all researchers having an affiliation with an US based non-profit institution. The workshop was designed to help researchers in getting a glance at the capabilities provided by OSG. <br/>

However, apart from leading the workshop I also got a chance to participate in other workshops and talks. The panel discussion about AI and its ethics was interesting. I came to know about [slidesGPT](https://slidesgpt.com/) from there. It generates slides based on the provided information. The API of `ChatGPT` is used in such different and innovative ways. One of the panelists was a `lawyer`. According to him the upsurge in AI and the available API's are presenting the startups with a great advantage. The startups now can compete with the well established companies if they can innovate. Previously the costs and overhead of maintaining a company sometimes made it very difficult for startups to compete on the open market. I wish the whole session was recorded. <br/>

I learnt the importance of building a regional CI (Cyber infrastructure) network. All the conference that I had attended before was focused on research only. GPN focused on `research computing` along with `professional` development. It presented me with the opportunity to learn numerous challenges that goes behind the scene of the computing world.
