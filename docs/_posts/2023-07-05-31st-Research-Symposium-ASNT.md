This was my first time attending the American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) conference in person. Last year, I had a presentation related to my dissertation and had received the travel grant too. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the conference and my adviser ended up presenting on my behalf. However, this year I got a chance to travel and met with the leaders in the NDE field.

# Turner group at ASNT
Trevor and Ramon presented their work on quantifying case carburization depth and detecting `MTR (Micro-textured-regions)`. The work was funded by Rolls Royce and Amsted Rail Brenco. Below is the group photo. We got a chance to meet with Andrea, Chris and Yongfeng (former Turner Lab members). Below is the group photo.

# Interesting Presentations at ASNT
Almost all the talks that I attended were very good. Some of the extra-ordinary work and plenary talk that I liked are 
- Work from Mike Lowe's group
- Air Force Research Laboratory's work on finding the ground truth in X-ray CT data. It was interesting to know that based on the type of `X-ray CT machine`-(resolution, Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR)) the amount of detected pores were very different. **CNR** was the main important factor in detecting porosity of different depths
- The statistics related presentation of Miss Jennifer Brown made me regret not taking enough statistics courses during my Ph.D.
- The presentation of Bruce Drinkwater on "Are the robots coming?"
