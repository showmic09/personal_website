I am a **HPC Application Specialist** working with the `Holland Computing Center` and a Research Computing Facilitator at the [OSG](https://osg-htc.org/). Though my official position is through the `Holland Computing Center`, as part of my job I also work as a postdoc with [Dr. Joseph Turner](https://engineering.unl.edu/mme/joseph-turner/) at the MME dept.  <br />

My background is in mechanical engineering and I obtained my PhD degree with a focus on ultrasonic NDE (Non-Destructive Evaluation) of materials. My dissertation was focused on characterizing two-phase polycristalline materials using ultrasonic responses from synthetic microstructures.<br /> 

I enjoy working with challenging problems, coding, learning new techniques. I am also an amateur photographer. I enjoy traveling and phtographing wildlife and landscapes.
I am learning new things through my research and work with distributed high throughput computing. I am planning to share the methods and knowledge in different posts through my website.
