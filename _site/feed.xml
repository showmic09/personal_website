<p>Holland Computing Center <strong>(HCC)</strong> is located at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It provides computing resources to the affiliates of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">University of Nebraska</code> system. Currently, the most advanced cluster that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HCC</code> has is <em>swan</em>. HCC provides <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">High Performance Computing</code> to its researchers.</p>

<h1 id="june-summer-workshop">June Summer Workshop</h1>
<p>Every year <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HCC</code> hosts a workshop in the summer teaching about the basics of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">High Performance Computing (HPC)</code>. It is usually in June. This year I got the opportunity to teach at the workshop. The lesson started with an introduction to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unix Shell</code>. The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs. The most popular Unix shell is the <strong>Bash</strong>. Bash is a program that lets the user run different commands from a command line interface <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(CLI)</code>. In case of the computing world, most of the clusters are designed to interact from a <strong>CLI</strong>. Learning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bash</code> or shell commands is very helpful for researchers as it provides users with the tools to do a lot of pre and post processing directly from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terminal</code> environment.<br /></p>

<h1 id="bash">Bash</h1>
<p>Software carpentry has a great lesson for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unix Shell</code>. The workshop followed the <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">software carpentry’s</a> lesson plan. The whole lesson is built in a way that makes it easier for anyone to start from scratch. Whenever I teach <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bash</code> I like to start by providing a background and usefulness for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bash</code>. When I started using HPC for the first time at <strong>UNL</strong>, I had zero experience of using unix shell or terminal. I started to learn some of the very basic commands. I relied heavily on <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a> for editing job submit file, looking through output and error messages, finding empty folders or jobs that failed. When I switched to a mac that pushed me to get better in using Bash. Mac did not have a good substitute of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WinSCP</code>. Cyberduck comes close but is still very far away from the functionalities that WinSCP offer.<br /></p>

<p>I shared all these experiences with the students. I hope my experience and different use cases of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bash commands</code> in my research will motivate the students.<br /></p>

<h1 id="useful-tips-and-tricks-for-bash">Useful Tips and Tricks for Bash</h1>
<p>Below are some of the commands and tips that I have found very useful for my work.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> moves the cursor to the front of the line in the terminal.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -lthr</code> lets me easily find the last edited file in a directory.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod +x</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod 755</code> to make a file executable</li>
  <li>execute the script from terminal using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./&lt;script_file_name&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$@</code> enables a shell script to accept any number of arguments</li>

It is a regional conference. The universities in South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas comprise the GPN. The conference took place in Kansas City from May 31 to June 2nd. I instructed the “Scaling Out Your Research on the Open Science Pool” workshop. The workshop had a great deal of hands on portion. The materials for the workshop can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o0AfBeb65hOEBE1iQLj7pH4V0nB1FiG-/edit#slide=id.p1">here</a>. <a href="https://osg-htc.org">OSG</a> is free for all researchers having an affiliation with an US based non-profit institution. The workshop was designed to help researchers in getting a glance at the capabilities provided by OSG. <br /></p>

<p>However, apart from leading the workshop I also got a chance to participate in other workshops and talks. The panel discussion about AI and its ethics was interesting. I came to know about <a href="https://slidesgpt.com/">slidesGPT</a> from there. It generates slides based on the provided information. The API of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ChatGPT</code> is used in such different and innovative ways. One of the panelists was a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lawyer</code>. According to him the upsurge in AI and the available API’s are presenting the startups with a great advantage. The startups now can compete with the well established companies if they can innovate. Previously the costs and overhead of maintaining a company sometimes made it very difficult for startups to compete on the open market. I wish the whole session was recorded. <br /></p>

<p>I learnt the importance of building a regional CI (Cyber infrastructure) network. All the conference that I had attended before was focused on research only. GPN focused on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">research computing</code> along with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">professional</code> development. It presented me with the opportunity to learn numerous challenges that goes behind the scene of the computing world.</p>]]></content><author><name>Showmic Islam</name></author><category term="docs" /><category term="GPN" /><category term="Conference" /><category term="Blogs" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was my first time at the Great Plains Network (GPN) conference.

Just like normal speech sounds echo is also noticed in case of ultrasound. Using the echo of the ultrasound different information about the body under investigation (materials, ceramics, biomaterials etc) can be obtained. It is one of the most popular non-destructive methods. <br /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ultrasound</code> is used widely in various industries for detection and identification of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defects</code> in polycrystalline materials. My research interest lies in quantifying polycrystalline materials through ultrasound. Using an ultrasonic transducer ultrasonic signal can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transmitted and received</code>. When ultrasound travels inside a polycrystalline material it scatters in all direction. From the reflected signal of the wave information about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">microstructure</code> of the material can be quantified. Some of the main properties of ultrasound is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase velocity</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attenuation</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backscatter</code>. Using these properties of ultrasound the microstructural properties of a material can be predicted. <br /></p>

<p>Ultrasonic wave <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scatters</code> when it passes through the grains of polycrystalline materials. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Grain boundaries</code> are the main sources of ultrasonic scattering and attenuation. Ultrasonics theories like Weaver’s model is specially helpful for understanding ultrasonic responses in polycrystalline materials. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5096651">Norouzian and Turner</a> developed the modifications necessary to apply ultrasonic theories to calculate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase velocity</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attenuation</code> using the discrete synthetic microstructures for cubic polycrystalline materials.<br /></p>

<p>My research work aims to further this approach of developing and testing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ultrasonic theories</code> applicable to discrete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">synthetic microstructures</code> for complex polycrystalline materials. The animation in this page is my lazy approach towards describing the ultrasonic properties. However, Iowa State University has built a great website regarding all the <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/Physics/index.xhtml">NDT techniques</a>. I would highly encourage interested readers to go through different sections in their website.

<p>Microstructure refers to the internal organization of a material. Due to the nature of my research I am focused on investigating polycrystalline materials. Polycrystalline materials refer to those materials that have many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crystals</code> e.g. Copper, Iron, Aluminum etc. If we put these materials under a microscope we can see that they consist of many small elements or building blocks like a jigsaw puzzle which we refer to as grains. <a href="http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/">DREAM.3D</a> and <a href="https://neper.info/">Neper</a> are two of the most prominent software for creation of two and three dimensional synthetic microstructures.<br /></p>

<h1 id="dream3d">DREAM.3D</h1>

<p>DREAM.3D fills up a given space with grains of random shapes and sizes, and allows them to grow in all directions untill no empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">voxels(3D pixels)</code> are remaining.</p>

<h2 id="slurm-script-for-dream3d">Slurm script for DREAM.3D</h2>
<p>More information about the inner workings of DREAM.3D can be found in Mike Groeber’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9772-3-5">paper</a>. Creation of a relatively realistic synthetic microstructures requires a lot of computing. I usually create the DREAM.3D synthetics in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Holland Computing Center (HCC)</code> Slurm based cluster.
The script to generate many realizations follows:</p>

<p>Neper is based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Voronoi</code> tessellation. Neper fills a given space with random <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seed</code> points. Neper has the capability to generate microstructures of different grain size distributions. The image below shows a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3D Voronoi polycrystal</code>.</p>

<p>As our codebase is for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">voxelized</code> format of synthetic microstructure, the generated polycrystals are converted to a raster or voxelized format. An example code for generating voronoi polycrystal in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slurm cluster</code> is shown below. Please note that the time of my investigation the current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">version</code> of Neper was <strong>3.5</strong>.</p>
