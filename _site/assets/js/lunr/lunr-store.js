        "title": "Creating Synthetic Microstructures",
        "excerpt":"  Microstructure refers to the internal organization of a material. Due to the nature of my research I am focused on investigating polycrystalline materials. Polycrystalline materials refer to those materials that have many crystals e.g. Copper, Iron, Aluminum etc. If we put these materials under a microscope we can see that they consist of many small elements or building blocks like a jigsaw puzzle which we refer to as grains. DREAM.3D and Neper are two of the most prominent software for creation of two and three dimensional synthetic microstructures.    DREAM.3D   DREAM.3D fills up a given space with grains of random shapes and sizes, and allows them to grow in all directions untill no empty voxels(3D pixels) are remaining.      Slurm script for DREAM.3D  More information about the inner workings of DREAM.3D can be found in Mike Groeber’s paper. Creation of a relatively realistic synthetic microstructures requires a lot of computing. I usually create the DREAM.3D synthetics in Holland Computing Center (HCC) Slurm based cluster. The script to generate many realizations follows:         #!/bin/sh #SBATCH --array=1-40 #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --time=127:00:00 #SBATCH --mem=64G #SBATCH -o two_phase_30-%A_%a.out --array=1-40  module load singularity mkdir /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;json file&gt;/$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID singularity exec -B /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;json file&gt;/$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID:/mnt docker://unlhcc/dream3d PipelineRunner -p /&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;json file&gt;/*.json  The GUI of DREAM.3D creates a .json file and it can be run from the command line using the PipelineRunner -p command.   Neper   Neper is based on Voronoi tessellation. Neper fills a given space with random seed points. Neper has the capability to generate microstructures of different grain size distributions. The image below shows a 3D Voronoi polycrystal.      Slurm script for Voronoi tessellation  As our codebase is for voxelized format of synthetic microstructure, the generated polycrystals are converted to a raster or voxelized format. An example code for generating voronoi polycrystal in a slurm cluster is shown below. Please note that the time of my investigation the current version of Neper was 3.5.         #!/bin/sh #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --array=1-10 #SBATCH --ntasks=10 #SBATCH --time=120:59:00        #SBATCH --mem=15G       #SBATCH --job-name=vor_9sd_500_cube_array #SBATCH -o slurm-%A_%a.out --array=1-10  module load neper/3.5 mkdir $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID cd $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID domain_val=500 mean_val=30 sd_val=9;  neper -T -n from_morpho -id $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID -domain \"cube($domain_val,$domain_val,$domain_val)\" -morpho \"voronoi,diameq:lognormal($mean_val,$sd_val)\" -format tesr,ori -tesrsize $domain_val -tesrformat binary16 -oricrysym cubic -ori random -statcell size,diameq,w -o voronoi_sd\"$sd_val\"_\"$domain_val\"    Slurm script for Laguerre tessellation  Laguerre tessellation is based on Voronoi tessellation. The main difference for Laguerre is that the generated seed are not equidistant from the grain boundary. Laguerre tessellation is used for simulating foams and is better in making a wider grain-size distributions.         #!/bin/sh #SBATCH --nodes=1 #SBATCH --array=1-10 #SBATCH --ntasks=10 #SBATCH --time=69:59:00        #SBATCH --mem=20G       #SBATCH --job-name=laguerre_sd9_200_cube_array #SBATCH -o slurm-%A_%a.out --array=1-10  module load neper/3.5 mkdir $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID cd $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID domain_val=500 mean_val=30 sd_val=9;  neper -T -n from_morpho -id $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID -domain \"cube($domain_val,$domain_val,$domain_val)\" -morpho \"diameq:lognormal($mean_val,$sd_val)\" -morphooptiini \"coo:packing,weight:0.5*diameq\" -format tesr,ori -tesrsize $domain_val -tesrformat binary16 -oricrysym cubic -ori random -statcell size,diameq,w -o laguerre_sd\"$sd_val\"_\"$domain_val\"  ","categories": ["docs"],

        "title": "Ultrasonic NDE",
        "excerpt":"Ultrasound refers a sound wave having a frequency of beyond 20000 Hz. Just like normal speech sounds echo is also noticed in case of ultrasound. Using the echo of the ultrasound different information about the body under investigation (materials, ceramics, biomaterials etc) can be obtained. It is one of the most popular non-destructive methods.     Ultrasound is used widely in various industries for detection and identification of defects in polycrystalline materials. My research interest lies in quantifying polycrystalline materials through ultrasound. Using an ultrasonic transducer ultrasonic signal can be transmitted and received. When ultrasound travels inside a polycrystalline material it scatters in all direction. From the reflected signal of the wave information about the microstructure of the material can be quantified. Some of the main properties of ultrasound is phase velocity, attenuation and backscatter. Using these properties of ultrasound the microstructural properties of a material can be predicted.     Ultrasonic wave scatters when it passes through the grains of polycrystalline materials. Grain boundaries are the main sources of ultrasonic scattering and attenuation. Ultrasonics theories like Weaver’s model is specially helpful for understanding ultrasonic responses in polycrystalline materials. Norouzian and Turner developed the modifications necessary to apply ultrasonic theories to calculate phase velocity and attenuation using the discrete synthetic microstructures for cubic polycrystalline materials.    My research work aims to further this approach of developing and testing the ultrasonic theories applicable to discrete synthetic microstructures for complex polycrystalline materials. The animation in this page is my lazy approach towards describing the ultrasonic properties. However, Iowa State University has built a great website regarding all the NDT techniques. I would highly encourage interested readers to go through different sections in their website.   ","categories": ["docs"],

        "excerpt":"This was my first time at the Great Plains Network (GPN) conference. It is a regional conference. The universities in South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas comprise the GPN. The conference took place in Kansas City from May 31 to June 2nd. I instructed the “Scaling Out Your Research on the Open Science Pool” workshop. The workshop had a great deal of hands on portion. The materials for the workshop can be found here. OSG is free for all researchers having an affiliation with an US based non-profit institution. The workshop was designed to help researchers in getting a glance at the capabilities provided by OSG.           GPN workshop on using OSPool   However, apart from leading the workshop I also got a chance to participate in other workshops and talks. The panel discussion about AI and its ethics was interesting. I came to know about slidesGPT from there. It generates slides based on the provided information. The API of ChatGPT is used in such different and innovative ways. One of the panelists was a lawyer. According to him the upsurge in AI and the available API’s are presenting the startups with a great advantage. The startups now can compete with the well established companies if they can innovate. Previously the costs and overhead of maintaining a company sometimes made it very difficult for startups to compete on the open market. I wish the whole session was recorded.     I learnt the importance of building a regional CI (Cyber infrastructure) network. All the conference that I had attended before was focused on research only. GPN focused on research computing along with professional development. It presented me with the opportunity to learn numerous challenges that goes behind the scene of the computing world.

        "excerpt":"Holland Computing Center  Holland Computing Center (HCC) is located at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It provides computing resources to the affiliates of University of Nebraska system. Currently, the most advanced cluster that HCC has is swan. HCC provides High Performance Computing to its researchers.   June Summer Workshop  Every year HCC hosts a workshop in the summer teaching about the basics of High Performance Computing (HPC). It is usually in June. This year I got the opportunity to teach at the workshop. The lesson started with an introduction to Unix Shell. The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs. The most popular Unix shell is the Bash. Bash is a program that lets the user run different commands from a command line interface (CLI). In case of the computing world, most of the clusters are designed to interact from a CLI. Learning Bash or shell commands is very helpful for researchers as it provides users with the tools to do a lot of pre and post processing directly from the terminal environment.    Bash  Software carpentry has a great lesson for the Unix Shell. The workshop followed the software carpentry’s lesson plan. The whole lesson is built in a way that makes it easier for anyone to start from scratch. Whenever I teach Bash I like to start by providing a background and usefulness for Bash. When I started using HPC for the first time at UNL, I had zero experience of using unix shell or terminal. I started to learn some of the very basic commands. I relied heavily on WinSCP for editing job submit file, looking through output and error messages, finding empty folders or jobs that failed. When I switched to a mac that pushed me to get better in using Bash. Mac did not have a good substitute of WinSCP. Cyberduck comes close but is still very far away from the functionalities that WinSCP offer.    I shared all these experiences with the students. I hope my experience and different use cases of Bash commands in my research will motivate the students.    Useful Tips and Tricks for Bash  Below are some of the commands and tips that I have found very useful for my work.     Ctrl + A moves the cursor to the front of the line in the terminal.   ls -lthr lets me easily find the last edited file in a directory.   chmod +x or chmod 755 to make a file executable   execute the script from terminal using a ./&lt;script_file_name&gt;   $@ enables a shell script to accept any number of arguments  ","categories": ["docs"],
